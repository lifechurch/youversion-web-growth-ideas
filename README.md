# YouVersion Web Growth Ideas

_This project is related to the web-application of The Bible App found at [Bible.com](https://www.bible.com)._

[Bible.com](https://www.bible.com) is a vital component of the YouVersion digital brand. It recently reached a new high in terms of organic search performance. It is going over 5 million organic clicks from Google this year. That’s more than any year in the past! But, we know there is so much more we could be doing or doing better.

We encourage you to delve into [Bible.com](https://www.bible.com) and offer suggestions on how we could enhance the site to boost organic traffic. We are primarily looking for simple ideas with a high return value. Of course, we’ll take the more involved ideas but may not choose to implement them.

## How To Contribute Your Growth Ideas

All growth ideas are tracked and discussed using GitHub issues.

First, check to see if your idea has already been presented. If it has, feel free to add to the conversation by commenting on the idea. If it hasn't, start the conversation by filling out our [growth idea template](#TODO).
