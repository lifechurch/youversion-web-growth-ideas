# YouVersion Web Growth Ideas

_This project is related to the web-application of The Bible App found at [Bible.com](https://www.bible.com)._

[Bible.com](https://www.bible.com) is a vital component of the YouVersion digital brand. It recently reached a new high in terms of organic search performance. It is going over 5 million organic clicks from Google this year. That’s more than any year in the past! But, we know there is so much more we could be doing or doing better.

We encourage you to delve into [Bible.com](https://www.bible.com) and offer suggestions on how we could enhance the site to boost organic traffic. We are primarily looking for simple ideas with a high return value. Of course, we’ll take the more involved ideas but may not choose to implement them.

## How To Contribute Your Growth Ideas

All growth ideas are tracked and discussed using GitHub issues.

First, check to see if your idea has already been presented. If it has, feel free to add to the conversation by commenting on the idea. If it hasn't, start the conversation by filling out a [growth idea](https://github.com/lifechurch/youversion-web-growth-ideas/issues/new?labels=growth&template=growth-idea.md&title=) submission.

When completing the template, be sure to include any examples of the change, indicate an estimated level of effort, and finally tell us how the idea will improve organic search performance to [Bible.com](https://www.bible.com)

## Have Other Ideas or Found a Bug

We are currently focusing on improving our organic traffic. However, we would enjoy hearing about any ideas you have that could help grow the reach of [Bible.com](https://www.bible.com)! Please fill out the suitable [issue template](https://github.com/lifechurch/youversion-web-growth-ideas/issues/new/choose) to submit your bug or idea.
